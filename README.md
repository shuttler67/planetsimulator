# planetsimulator
A project exploring the unity ECS and burst features available for 2018.2.0f

We casually simulate 100000 circles connected to each other and colliding with each other.

This is one of those projects where I started trying to make a game and end up making a simple verlet physics engine instead. Every god damn time.
